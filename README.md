# WhichPrep
Final Year Project (2.1 Grade Received)

WhichPrep is an educational application developed for Android. It aims to aid the user, typically a non-native English speaker, in 
their use of prepositional words in sentences. This is the main area in which people learning the English language have difficulty with.

The app tests the user by presenting them with a series of sentences missing the prepositional word. These sentences are scraped dynamically from
articles on the web, ensuring the user is never testied on the same question twice. The user can either choose the correct word 
from a list of three choices, or use the phones microphone to speak the word they feel is correct.

The app analyzes user choice and time spent per question and through this provides informative feedback and identifies weaknesses so 
as to improve the users use of the English language.
